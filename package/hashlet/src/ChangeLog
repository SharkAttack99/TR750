	[1] http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch10s05.html

2013-12-26  Josh Datko  <jbdatko@gmail.com>

	Refactored command line dispatcher.

	Added the MAC command to take in an arbitrary length file.  This depends on libgcrypt to guarantee a 32 byte available.  Another way to do this is to not directly depend on an external hash implementation, but to take in 32 bytes directly.  I think it's easier for the user to not have to pipe an external command first.
	If libgcrypt is not available, this feature will be not be enabled.

	Added initial unit tests for #14.
